- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we are @BrainSoftwareHouse from NeuroChipLab (PI Stefano Vassanelli) located in University of Padova
Our work introduces OptoAnalyzer, an innovative software designed to address critical challenges in histological image analysis by offering a semi-automated, 
user-friendly workflow that bridges the gap between labor-intensive manual methods and rigid automated systems. The core idea behind OptoAnalyzer is to provide
 a reliable yet intuitive tool with a flawless pipeline that requires only a few steps, approximately 30 seconds, to analyze one slice. 
 OptoAnalyzer significantly enhances efficiency and reproducibility in optogenetics and fluorescence imaging studies. 
 Most importantly, OptoAnalyzer can effectively manage portions of slices and/or damaged slices, which commonly occur when processing brain images.


Iâ€™m a neuroscientist dedicated to making your research journey smoother.
Weâ€™re developing innovative tools to help you explore the vast and fascinating world of the brain. Letâ€™s make discoveriesâ€”and have funâ€”together!
